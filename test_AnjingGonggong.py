```
Scenario 1: Verify the gonggong method is calling the super method
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_calling_super
  Description: This test is to verify that the gonggong method is calling the super method from the parent class Anjing. This is a key part of the business logic, as it ensures the method is behaving as a proper subclass method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a given name. Mock the superclass's gonggong method to track its invocation.
  Act: Call the gonggong method on the instance.
  Assert: Confirm that the superclass's gonggong method was called.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the subclass method is calling the superclass method, as per the business logic. If this is not happening, the method is not behaving as expected and could lead to bugs or incorrect behavior.

Scenario 2: Verify the gonggong method's return value
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_return_value
  Description: This test is to verify that the gonggong method is returning the expected value "woork". This is crucial to the business logic, as this is the expected output when the method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a given name.
  Act: Call the gonggong method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is "woork".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method is returning the expected output. If the output is different, this indicates a problem with the method's functionality, which could impact the overall behavior of the program.

Scenario 3: Verify the gonggong method's behavior with different instances
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_different_instances
  Description: This test is to verify that the gonggong method behaves consistently across different instances of the class. This is important for the business logic, as it ensures the method's reliability and consistency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple instances of the class with different names.
  Act: Call the gonggong method on each instance.
  Assert: Confirm that the method's behavior is consistent across all instances, i.e., it calls the superclass method and returns "woork".
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the method behaves consistently, regardless of the instance it is called on. Consistency is key in ensuring reliable and predictable behavior, which is essential for maintaining high-quality software.
