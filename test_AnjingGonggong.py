```
Scenario 1: Validate the gonggong method
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong
  Description: This test verifies that the gonggong method returns the correct value, which is "woork", and that it calls the parent class's gonggong method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the Anjing class with a given name.
  Act: Invoke the gonggong method on the initialized object without any parameters.
  Assert: Check that the return value is "woork" and that the parent class's gonggong method has been called.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the primary functionality of the gonggong method. It checks if the method works as expected and returns the correct result. The expected result "woork" is a specification derived from the business requirement and is thus crucial to validate.

Scenario 2: Verify the inheritance of gonggong method
Details:
  TestName: test_inheritance_gonggong
  Description: This test verifies that the gonggong method in Anjing class correctly inherits from its parent class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the Anjing class with a given name.
  Act: Invoke the gonggong method on the created object.
  Assert: Verify that the gonggong method of the parent class is called.
Validation:
  The test is crucial as it verifies the correct implementation of inheritance, which is a core aspect of the object-oriented programming paradigm. Ensuring the gonggong method in the Anjing class correctly inherits from its parent class is vital to maintain the expected behavior and integrity of the application.

Scenario 3: Check the interaction with the nama field
Details:
  TestName: test_nama_interaction
  Description: This test is to verify if the gonggong method interacts with the nama field in the expected way.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the Anjing class with a given name.
  Act: Invoke the gonggong method on the initialized object.
  Assert: Verify that the nama field remains unchanged after the method execution.
Validation:
  This test validates that the gonggong method does not have any unintended side effects on the nama field. As per the business logic, the nama field should not be modified by the gonggong method, ensuring the integrity of the data.
