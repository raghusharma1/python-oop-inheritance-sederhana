Scenario 1: Validate the function gonggong output
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_output
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function gonggong correctly outputs 'Suara gonggongan hewan' when invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class with the constructor. No other setup is needed as the function gonggong does not take any parameters or depend on any other state.
  Act: Invoke the function gonggong using the initialized object.
  Assert: Check if the output of the function is 'Suara gonggongan hewan'.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the function gonggong. The function is expected to output 'Suara gonggongan hewan' whenever it is invoked, and this test verifies if that requirement is met.

Scenario 2: Validate the function gonggong does not modify the class object
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_no_side_effects
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function gonggong does not have any side effects i.e., it does not modify the state of the object when invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class with the constructor. Save a copy of the object before invoking the function.
  Act: Invoke the function gonggong using the initialized object.
  Assert: Compare the object before and after the function invocation to check if there are any changes.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function gonggong has any unintended side effects. The function is not expected to modify the state of the object, and this test verifies if that requirement is met.

Scenario 3: Validate the function gonggong with multiple invocations
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_multiple_invocations
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function gonggong behaves consistently across multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class with the constructor.
  Act: Invoke the function gonggong multiple times using the initialized object.
  Assert: Check if the output of the function is 'Suara gonggongan hewan' for each invocation.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function gonggong behaves consistently across multiple invocations. The function is expected to output 'Suara gonggongan hewan' whenever it is invoked, and this test verifies if that requirement is met consistently.
