```
Scenario 1: Test the output of the gonggong function
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_output
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the gonggong function successfully prints the correct string, 'Suara gonggongan hewan'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and assign it to a variable.
  Act: Call the gonggong function on the instance.
  Assert: Check if the output of the function is the string 'Suara gonggongan hewan'.
Validation:
  This test is important as it ensures that the gonggong function is working as expected and producing the correct output. It verifies that the function's implementation aligns with the business requirement of printing a specific string.

Scenario 2: Test the gonggong function's effect on the class instance
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_no_side_effects
  Description: This test is intended to verify that calling the gonggong function does not alter the state of the class instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, assign it to a variable, and store its initial state.
  Act: Call the gonggong function on the instance.
  Assert: Compare the state of the instance after the function call with its initial state and ensure they are identical.
Validation:
  This test is important as it ensures that the gonggong function does not have any unexpected side effects on the class instance. It verifies that the function's implementation aligns with the business requirement of not altering the state of the class instance.
  
Scenario 3: Test the gonggong function with different class instances
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_multiple_instances
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the gonggong function works correctly with different instances of the class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple instances of the class.
  Act: Call the gonggong function on each instance.
  Assert: Check if the output of the function is the same for each instance and matches the expected string 'Suara gonggongan hewan'.
Validation:
  This test is important as it ensures that the gonggong function works correctly and consistently across different instances of the class. It verifies that the function's implementation aligns with the business requirement of providing consistent output.
