```
Scenario 1: Validate the object's response to the gonggong function
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_response
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the gonggong function is working properly by checking the response of the function when called on an object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class, for instance, dog = Anjing('Anjing')
  Act: Invoke the function on the object, dog.gonggong()
  Assert: The expected outcome is printing 'Suara gonggongan hewan'. This will be checked by capturing the stdout and comparing it to the expected string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the gonggong method is functioning as expected and producing the correct output when called on an object. This is a basic functionality that should work correctly for the system to run as expected.

Scenario 2: Validate the gonggong function across multiple objects
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_multiple_objects
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the gonggong function works consistently across multiple objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize multiple objects of the class, for example, dog = Anjing('Anjing'), wolf = Srigala('Serigala'), lion = Singa('Singa')
  Act: Invoke the function on each object, for example, dog.gonggong(), wolf.gonggong(), lion.gonggong()
  Assert: The expected outcome is printing 'Suara gonggongan hewan' for each object. This will be checked by capturing the stdout and comparing it to the expected string for each object.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the gonggong function works consistently across different objects. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and ensuring that the function doesn't behave differently for different objects.

Scenario 3: Validate the gonggong function with different object names
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_different_names
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the gonggong function works correctly even when objects have different names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize objects with different names, for instance, dog1 = Anjing('Anjing1'), dog2 = Anjing('Anjing2')
  Act: Invoke the function on each object, for instance, dog1.gonggong(), dog2.gonggong()
  Assert: The expected outcome is printing 'Suara gonggongan hewan' for each object. This will be checked by capturing the stdout and comparing it to the expected string for each object.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the gonggong function doesn't depend on the object's name and works correctly regardless of it. This is crucial for ensuring that the function is robust and doesn't fail when dealing with objects having different names.
