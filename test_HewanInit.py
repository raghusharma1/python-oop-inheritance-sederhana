```
Scenario 1: Test the initialization of the object with a valid name
Details:
  TestName: test_object_initialization_with_valid_name
  Description: This test will verify the correct initialization of the object with a valid name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with a valid name as the parameter.
  Act: Access the 'nama' attribute of the object.
  Assert: Check if the 'nama' attribute of the object is equal to the name passed during initialization.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the object is correctly initialized with the given name. This is essential as it forms the base for all other operations that would be performed on the object.

Scenario 2: Test the initialization of the object with an empty name
Details:
  TestName: test_object_initialization_with_empty_name
  Description: This test will verify the behavior of the method when an empty string is passed as the name during object initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with an empty string as the name.
  Act: Access the 'nama' attribute of the object.
  Assert: Check if the 'nama' attribute of the object is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior with edge case input. While the function may not explicitly prevent this, it could have implications for other methods that use the 'nama' attribute.

Scenario 3: Test the initialization of the object with a numeric name
Details:
  TestName: test_object_initialization_with_numeric_name
  Description: This test will verify the behavior of the method when a numeric value is passed as the name during object initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with a numeric value as the name.
  Act: Access the 'nama' attribute of the object.
  Assert: Check if the 'nama' attribute of the object is the numeric value that was passed.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior with unconventional input. It ensures that the function can handle a variety of input types, even if they are not typically expected.
