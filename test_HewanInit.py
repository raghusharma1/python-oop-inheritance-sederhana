```
Scenario 1: Validate Correct Initialization
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_initialization
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the __init__ method correctly initializes the object with the provided name.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are testing object initialization.
  Act: Create an object of the class, passing a name to the constructor.
  Assert: Check that the object's nama attribute matches the name passed in.
Validation:
  It is important to ensure that the object is being initialized correctly because all other methods on the object will rely on this initialization. If the name is not set correctly, it may lead to errors or incorrect behavior in other parts of the program.

Scenario 2: Name Attribute Is Not None
Details:
  TestName: test_name_attribute_not_none
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the name attribute of the object is not None after initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are testing object initialization.
  Act: Create an object of the class, passing a name to the constructor.
  Assert: Check that the object's nama attribute is not None.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the object's name attribute is correctly set and not left as None. This is important as other methods may rely on the name attribute being set to a valid value and may fail or behave incorrectly if it is None.

Scenario 3: Empty String Initialization
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_string_initialization
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the __init__ method can handle being passed an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are testing object initialization.
  Act: Create an object of the class, passing an empty string to the constructor.
  Assert: Check that the object's nama attribute is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the object's name attribute can be set to an empty string. This is important to verify as it checks the method's ability to handle edge cases and behave as expected when passed unusual input.
