```
Scenario 1: Test for object initialization with valid string name
Details:
  TestName: test_object_initialization_with_valid_name
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the object is correctly initialized with a valid string name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object with a string name.
  Act: Instantiate the object with a string name such as 'Anjing'.
  Assert: Check if the name attribute of the object is correctly set to 'Anjing'.
Validation:
  It's crucial to ensure that objects are initialized correctly as it forms the basis of object-oriented programming. Correct initialization is critical for the object to behave as expected in subsequent operations.

Scenario 2: Test for object initialization with empty string name
Details:
  TestName: test_object_initialization_with_empty_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the initialization function when an empty string is passed as the name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object with an empty string.
  Act: Instantiate the object with an empty string ''.
  Assert: Check if the name attribute of the object is set to an empty string.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases correctly. It's not specified whether empty strings are valid names, so it's important to check the function's behavior in such cases.

Scenario 3: Test for object initialization with non-string type name
Details:
  TestName: test_object_initialization_with_non_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the initialization function when a non-string type name is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object with a non-string type name.
  Act: Instantiate the object with a non-string type name such as 123.
  Assert: Check if the name attribute of the object is set to '123' or if it throws an appropriate error.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure that the function handles non-string type names correctly. This will help in maintaining data consistency and avoiding unexpected behaviors.

Scenario 4: Test for object initialization with special characters in the name
Details:
  TestName: test_object_initialization_with_special_characters
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the initialization function when a name with special characters is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object with a name containing special characters.
  Act: Instantiate the object with a name such as '!@#Anjing###'.
  Assert: Check if the name attribute of the object is set to '!@#Anjing###'.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles names with special characters correctly. This is crucial for data consistency and to avoid potential errors during subsequent operations.
