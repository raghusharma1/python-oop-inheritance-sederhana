```
Scenario 1: Validating object initialization with a non-empty string
Details:
  TestName: test_initialization_with_non_empty_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the __init__ function properly initializes the object when a non-empty string is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object with a non-empty string.
  Act: Invoke the __init__ function with a non-empty string parameter.
  Assert: The nama attribute of the object should be equal to the non-empty string passed as a parameter.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the basic functionality of the __init__ function. The expected result is that the nama attribute of the object should be equal to the non-empty string passed as a parameter, which complies with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Validating object initialization with an empty string
Details:
  TestName: test_initialization_with_empty_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the __init__ function properly initializes the object when an empty string is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object with an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the __init__ function with an empty string parameter.
  Assert: The nama attribute of the object should be equal to the empty string passed as a parameter.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the functionality of the __init__ function when an empty string is passed. The expected result is that the nama attribute of the object should be equal to the empty string passed as a parameter, which complies with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Validating object initialization with a None value
Details:
  TestName: test_initialization_with_none
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the __init__ function properly initializes the object when None is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object with None.
  Act: Invoke the __init__ function with None as a parameter.
  Assert: The nama attribute of the object should be equal to None.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the functionality of the __init__ function when None is passed. The expected result is that the nama attribute of the object should be equal to None, which complies with the function's specifications and business requirements.
