```
Scenario 1: Test when the function gonggong is invoked on the object
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_invocation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function gonggong gets invoked properly without any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object by passing a name to the constructor.
  Act: Invoke the function gonggong on the object.
  Assert: Check if the function invocation doesn't throw any error or exception.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function gonggong can be invoked on the object without any issues. This is basic functionality and should always be possible, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Test the effect of the function gonggong on the object's state
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_effect
  Description: This test is intended to verify the changes in the object's state after the function gonggong is invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object by passing a name to the constructor. Take a snapshot of the object's state.
  Act: Invoke the function gonggong on the object.
  Assert: Compare the object's state after the function invocation with the snapshot taken before the invocation.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function gonggong is having the expected effect on the object's state. The exact changes expected would depend on the intended business logic encapsulated by the function.

Scenario 3: Test the return value of the function gonggong
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_return
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function gonggong returns the expected value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object by passing a name to the constructor.
  Act: Invoke the function gonggong on the object and capture the return value.
  Assert: Check if the return value matches the expected value.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function gonggong is returning the correct value, as per the function's specifications and business requirements. The exact return value expected would depend on the intended business logic encapsulated by the function.
