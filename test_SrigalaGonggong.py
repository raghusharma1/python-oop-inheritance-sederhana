Scenario 1: Test gonggong method with a valid animal object
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_valid_animal
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the gonggong method works correctly when called on a valid animal object. The expected behavior is that it should return the string 'hooooowll'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an animal object with a valid name.
  Act: Invoke the gonggong method on the initialized animal object.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to 'hooooowll'.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the gonggong method. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications as it should return 'hooooowll' when called on a valid animal object.

Scenario 2: Test gonggong method after changing animal's name
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_after_name_change
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the gonggong method still functions correctly after the name of the animal object has been changed. The expected behavior is that it should still return the string 'hooooowll' regardless of the animal's name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an animal object with a valid name, then change the name of the animal object.
  Act: Invoke the gonggong method on the animal object after its name has been changed.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to 'hooooowll'.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the robustness of the gonggong method. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications as it should return 'hooooowll' regardless of the animal's name.

Scenario 3: Test gonggong method when called multiple times
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_multiple_calls
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the gonggong method still functions correctly when called multiple times on the same animal object. The expected behavior is that it should return the string 'hooooowll' each time it is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an animal object with a valid name.
  Act: Invoke the gonggong method on the animal object multiple times.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to 'hooooowll' each time the method is called.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the consistency of the gonggong method. The expected result is connected to the function's specifications as it should return 'hooooowll' each time it is called.
