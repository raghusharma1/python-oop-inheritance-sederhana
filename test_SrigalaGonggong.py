```
Scenario 1: Test the gonggong function when the object is initialized with a valid name
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_with_valid_name
  Description: This test is intended to verify the business logic of the gonggong method when the object is initialized with a valid name. The method is expected to return "hooooowll".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class with a valid name.
  Act: Invoke the gonggong method on the initialized object.
  Assert: Check that the return value of the method is "hooooowll".
Validation:
  This test is important as it ensures that the gonggong method behaves as expected when the object is initialized with a valid name. The expected result is in line with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Test the gonggong function when the object is not initialized
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_without_initialization
  Description: This test is intended to verify the business logic of the gonggong method when the object is not initialized. The method is expected to raise an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not initialize an object of the class.
  Act: Attempt to invoke the gonggong method.
  Assert: Check that an error is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important as it ensures that the gonggong method behaves as expected when the object is not initialized. This is a crucial aspect of the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Test the gonggong function when the object is initialized with an empty string
Details:
  TestName: test_gonggong_with_empty_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify the business logic of the gonggong method when the object is initialized with an empty string. The method is expected to return "hooooowll".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class with an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the gonggong method on the initialized object.
  Assert: Check that the return value of the method is "hooooowll".
Validation:
  This test is important as it ensures that the gonggong method behaves as expected even when the object is initialized with an empty string. The expected result is in line with the function's specifications and business requirements.
