Scenario 1: Test if the damage calculation is correct
Details:
  TestName: test_damage_calculation
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the damage calculation (serangan // pertahanan) is correct.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object with specific values for serangan and pertahanan.
  Act: Invoke the serang function with the object.
  Assert: Check if the calculated damage is the same as expected.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the connection of the expected result to the function's specifications and business requirements: The damage calculation is a crucial part of the game mechanics and thus needs to be correct. The expected result is the integer division of serangan and pertahanan, which is the business rule specified.

Scenario 2: Test if the damage is zero when the defense is higher than the attack
Details:
  TestName: test_defense_higher_than_attack
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the damage is zero when the defense (pertahanan) value is higher than the attack (serangan) value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object with a higher value for pertahanan than serangan.
  Act: Invoke the serang function with the object.
  Assert: Check if the calculated damage is zero.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the connection of the expected result to the function's specifications and business requirements: According to the business rule of the game, if the defense is higher than the attack, the damage should be zero. 

Scenario 3: Test if the character names and enemy names are printed correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_character_enemy_name_print
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the character's name and enemy's name are printed correctly when the serang function is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object with specific values for nama and lawan.
  Act: Invoke the serang function with the object.
  Assert: Check if the printed output contains the character's name and the enemy's name.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the connection of the expected result to the function's specifications and business requirements: This test verifies if the serang function correctly prints the names of the character and the enemy, which is important for user interaction and game immersion. 

Scenario 4: Test if the function works with maximum integer values
Details:
  TestName: test_max_integer_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the serang function can handle and correctly calculate damage when maximum integer values are used for serangan and pertahanan.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object with maximum integer values for serangan and pertahanan.
  Act: Invoke the serang function with the object.
  Assert: Check if the calculated damage is as expected.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the connection of the expected result to the function's specifications and business requirements: This test verifies if the function can handle maximum integer values and still perform the calculation correctly, which is important for ensuring the game can handle extreme scenarios.
